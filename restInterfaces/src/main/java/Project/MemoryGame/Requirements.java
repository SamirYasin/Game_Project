            Summary of the game:
             This going to be a game that tests the users' memory. The game will start at three numbers that will
            randomly be flashed one at a time to the user. After the numbers are show, the user will have to pass those three numbers in the
            order the number was shown. If they get it correct, they will go up a level and be shown another set of random numbers with an
            additional number added at the end (four numbers in this case). If they get it incorrect, they will drop a level and be shown
            a new random set of numbers just one less than they were shown before. If the user fails three times (doesn't have to be in a row),
            they will lose the game.

            Technical requirements:
            - Every game starts at level 1 (level one shows three numbers)
            - If a user fails at level 1 one time, they lose the game (level one shows 3 numbers if they can't remember three numbers their memory is shit lmao)
            - Each level flashes a random sequence of numbers to the user
            - Everytime the user passes a round, they go up a level and get an extra number added to the sequence of new numbers they will be shown
            - If the user fail a round, they drop a level and get one number less shown to them in the new random sequence of numbers
            - If a user fails three rounds (doesn't have to be in a row) they lose the game
            - Once a user loses the game show them their highest round that they've completed (so we have to keep track of the highest level a user has gotten to)
